  <p id="intro"> Oh no, the flowers are posionous and will make Pinky Lamb and Bear sick if they eat them. They can't eat more than two flowers or they'll cry. Try to eat the cookies and avoid the flowers. Use the arrow keys or the touchscreen in order to move Pinky Lamb. Use the 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D' keys to move Bear if you have two players. </p>
